## Getting an API Key
To use authenticated endpoints, you need an **API Key**.  
You can generate and manage your API keys from the [SecretCryptos Partner page](https://secretcryptos.com/partner).

> ⚠️ Keep your API key secret. Never expose it in client-side code. Use it only in server-side applications.
